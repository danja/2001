*          Installation and usage of the createrss class                   *
****************************************************************************

Installation is very easy. Copy the createrss.php.* file of your
choice to a directory where you want to use it. Rename the file to
createrss.php. 

To create a rss file you will have to provide a few parameters:

require ("createrss.php");

$genrss = new mysql_rss; // If you are using the msql version you should use
			    $genrss = new msql_rss;
			    

Next you will have to provide some information on the host, databasename,
username and password.

$genrss->host     = "hostname";
$genrss->db       = "databasename";
$genrss->login    = "username";
$genrss->password = "password";

//The fieldnames for the data that you want to use:

$genrss->title_field = "fieldname to be used for the newsheader";
$genrss->descr_field = "fieldname to be used for the description field";
$genrss->link_field  = "fieldname to be used for the url field";

//The SQL query to be run. Make sure that the fields are included in this
//query.

$genrss->sql      = "SELECT * FROM tabel ORDER BY datum DESC limit 10";

//Some base information for the channel file:

$genrss->rss_title = "Title of the channel file";
$genrss->rss_link  = "http://linux.gelrevision.nl";
$genrss->rss_descr = "Description of the site";
$genrss->rss_lang  = "Language field which identifies the country (nl/us)";
$genrss->rss_encoding = "UTF-8";

// And the filename.
$genrss->connect("blabla.rss");

Make sure that you can write to both the directory and the produced file.

****************************************************************************
*                     Using the parserss class                             *
****************************************************************************

To parse a Netscape Channel (rss file) you have to instance the new class

<?php

require ("parserss.php");
$news = new readrss;

//Next you will have to tell the instance which file to read and make it parse.

$news->xml_file = "channelname.rss";
$news->parse();

?>

The above code will give you a simple ticker which will parse all the headlines.

Optional there are a few more functions that you can use:

1.  $news->headingColors('white','blue');
	Set a colors for the channelbackground and the headline background.
	If it's not set it will have a default color.

2.  $news->enableItemDescriptions(); 
	Some channels have extra information in a description field, this
	function will show them.
	
3.  $news->enableChannelDescription();
	This will show the channeldescription just beneath the channel title.
	
4.   $news->enableChannelSearchbox();
	This is an option which has only been seen in the 
	Freshmeat channel. Might be cool if Patrick would 
	submit a correct link to the search engine in the 
	Freshmeat rss file.

5.  $news->enableChannelPicture();
	This will enable a picture that is linked within the rss file.

6.  $news->setImageCache("images")             
	Caching dir for the pictures.
	
	To use this option you will have to create a dir (a subdir of
	the location where the classes are located would keep it together) 
	and chmod that dir to 777. This allows you to cache the pictures.

7.  $news->headingColors('white','blue');
	Set a colors for the channelbackground and the headline background.	
	
8.  $news->browseMethod('new');
	Default a click on one of the links will take the visitor
	to the link within the browser window ('_top'). Setting this option
	will allow you to spawn another window. 
	
9.  $news->maxlines = INT; 
	This will set a max number of headlines in a channel.
