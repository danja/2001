<h1>Counting Angels on a Pinhead</h1>
<p>An endless discussion that never gets satisfactorily resolved. Generally a 
  discussion that really doesn't do anybody any good. A sign that the wrong questions 
  are been asked, time to start a new thread.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b><cite>Evidence that <a href="http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/">xml-dev</a> 
  has a precedent...</cite></b></i></p>
<p><cite>I think the &quot;pinhead&quot; version appears in Francis Bacon's Novum 
  Organum,<br>
  though I don't have a reference; for him it is an instance of useless<br>
  investigation.</cite></p>
<p><cite>I am sure that the question as stated is a distortion of a position reported<br>
  by Aquinas. In Summa theol. I q.52 a.2 resp. he refutes those who<br>
  &quot;crediderunt quod angelus non posset esse nisi in loco punctali - who<br>
  believe that an angel is not able to exist except in a place that is a<br>
  point,&quot; i.e. that is indivisible and has a site (&quot;punctum est indivisibile<br>
  habens sitam&quot;). This, of course, is the point (punctus) of Euclidean<br>
  geometry applied to the real, physical world (not just the ideal point of<br>
  geometrical discourse). No one was talking about a &quot;pinhead,&quot; which 
  only<br>
  grossly approximates the punctum Aquinas is talking about, because a pinhead<br>
  is divisible. Aquinas quickly disposes of the proposition that an angel<br>
  occupies an indivisible punctum: an angel, he says, is &quot;indivisibile extra<br>
  genus quantitatis et situs existens,&quot; viz. it is indivisible without<br>
  reference to quantity and some real location. So for Aquinas, &quot;how many<br>
  angels can dance on the head of a pin&quot; is a meaningless question. If it 
  was<br>
  ever debated subsequently, it was only raised as an exercise to see if the<br>
  respondent knew his Aquinas. Which is to say, it was not a serious<br>
  question, even if punctum is properly understood. The &quot;pinhead&quot; version 
  is<br>
  still less serious, being most probably an ignorant (Renaissance humanist)<br>
  misunderstanding, if not a deliberate distortion.</cite></p>

<cite>The libel about the scholastics debating `whether a million angels<br>
may not fit upon a needles point?' is in Chillingworth's<br>
The Religion of Protestants a Safe Way to Salvation<br>
(1638, repr. 1972, 12th unnumbered page of the preface). </cite> 
<p><cite>It has never been found in any actual scholastic.</cite></p>
