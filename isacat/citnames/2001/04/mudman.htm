<h2>Mudman Spec</h2>
<p>I use this term to describe a specification that is not structurally sound 
  but might have a form that could be usable with a little squishing.</p>
<p>Not far off the American slang '<a href="#strawman">strawman</a>', but I don't 
  like this term as the root English equivalent 'scarecrow' carries nothing like 
  the same connotations. I'm thinking that horror film with the crap lion in it, 
  and a bloke that looks like a bucket. I believe a strawman in this context was 
  originally a candidate that was put up for political office with the prior knowledge 
  that they wouldn't stand a chance. A scarecrow stands in a field, errm, scaring 
  crows.</p>

<p>Additionally, I have always had a soft spot for the <a href="http://www.uq.net.au/%7Ezzlhiess/papua_new_guinea.htm">mudmen 
  of New Guinea</a> :</p>
