<P>Hiya,</P>
<P>I'd better explain. Poya is the Buddhist full moon holiday in Sri Lanka, a 
  bit like Sunday used to be in the UK - you can't do anything (particularly if 
  it involves unguents, see <A href="#Precepts">Precept 7 below</A>). It seemed 
  a good time to let you know of developments in our Sri Lanka trip. Yes, Caroline 
  and I are definitely going on the 4th Sept, all being well staying for a year. 
  Flight booked, bags packed (not), house let (not), accomodation arranged (pretty 
  much). When we arrive we'll be staying with Mr. Silva at the Randomba Inn, Randombe 
  near Ambalangoda. </P>

<P>Although there's a full blown civil war going on in the North &amp; East, we 
  didn't see much evidence of this in the South apart from the occasional roadblock. 
  It's very hard to tell what's actually going on - the press can't say a lot. 
  There's quite a good source of news at<A href="http://www.lankapage.com/"> 'Lanka 
  Page' </A>- they have stories from different papers in the region (often completely 
  contradictory).</P>
<P>One less obvious danger area is cricket matches :</P>

      <P><FONT face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">COLOMBO: A local umpire 
        officiating in a village cricket tournament at the southern coastal town 
        of Ambalangoda last Sunday was clubbed to death by players over a disputed 
        run out, the Daily Mirror reported on Thursday. The newspaper, quoting 
        police officials, said the umpire, identified as W Kamal Ranjith De Silva, 
        was rushed to hospital after he was beaten hard with iron bars by three 
        players following a heated argument over a runout decision. De Silva was 
        a member of the southern provincial council Softball Cricket Umpires Association. 
        The last match he officiated was organised by a well-known club in the 
        area. Two people were arrested in this connection and hunt was on for 
        others, police said. (PTI)</FONT></P>

<P align="left">We're going to stay in whatever Mr. Silva's got available for 
  now, then hopefully find a basic little house. Caro's hoping to get some teaching 
  work, though Mr. S has mentioned the possibility of doing something tourist-oriented. 
  I'm hoping I'll get enough writing work from Wrox etc. to pay the rent. Caro's 
  put the house up here for rent, though the only interested person so far cancelled 
  before viewing. There might be mortgage to pay if no-one moves in, which would 
  be a pain.</P>

  I packed a bag of tools, including a new tenon saw and a brace &amp; bit I bought

  Computer books are bloody heavy. We've each sent a parcel ahead - I sent 14kg 
  of books, by sea - about &pound;60. So I'm down to my favourite gouges and a 
  couple of obscure AI books I'd have trouble getting hold of out there. Clothes
