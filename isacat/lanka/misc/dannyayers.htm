<p>The real DANNY AYERS !</p>
<p>Yes, this page is going to mention my name a lot - my name is <a href="http://www.isacat.co.uk">Daniel 
  John Ayers</a>, more often known as Danny Ayers or just plain Danny. Quite often 
  my name is mispelt as Danny Ayres - banks seem to like this one. </p>
<p>The purpose of this page is to try and get above the search engine listings 
  of a certain <a href="http://danny.xtn.net/%20">Danny Lee Ayers, Jr.</a> of 
  Tennessee. Not that I bear him any grudge, after all, he spells his name correctly, 
  Danny Ayers rather than Ayres (sometimes even get Eyres - ugh!). Try to think 
  what it feels like to be mistaken for a 'Donny'...or even <i>be </i>one, God 
  forbid.</p>
<p>Danny Ayers in his Inventory Specialist Office at Wal-Mart :</p>
<p><a href="../postcard2/garden.jpg"><img src="danny.jpg" width="200" height="184" alt="Danny Ayers" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Not! </p>
<p> You can tell the difference if you look closely : Daniel Lee Ayers != Daniel 
  John Ayers. Coincidently, he also likes Dreamweaver and Photoshop, and apparently 
  he did a bit of Java at University. Unlike D.L.Ayers, D.J. Ayers is not married 
  and has most definitely not worked at Wal-Mart (Inventory Specialist - can you 
  imagine!!!!) .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, so the shirt &amp; tie look a tad Wal-Mart...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So gimmee a D - <font size="6">D!</font></p>
<p>gimmee an A - <font size="6">A!</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
no, I'm not going to continue with that one...but I might as well throw in a few 
gratuitous ones (to the tune of 'Here we go' (to a tune of Souza?): 
<h3>Danny Ayers Danny Ayers Danny Ayers, Danny Ayers Danny Ayers Danny <i>Ay</i>-ers...</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Click on the picture</b> for a more up to date one - I haven't worn a proper 
  shirt, let alone a tie for a long time, not since since moving <a href="../index.htm">here</a>. 
  The plastic palm tree on top of the monitor was an indication of what was to 
  come... </p>
<p>Anyway, if you are looking for Danny J. Ayers, the English one, who didn't 
  go to Unicoi County High School, Erwin, TN but bloody Lady Manners, Bakewell, 
  Derbyshire (should that DS?), UK and never worked at Little Caesar's Pizza, 
  Erwin, TN (far too lazy), you should see if you can find Danny Ayers <a href="http://www.isacat.co.uk">here 
  </a>or even by clicking on <a href="http://www.isacat.co.uk">Danny Ayers</a>, 
  or <a href="http://members.xoom.com/_XMCM/dayers/lanka/index.htm">here</a> even 
  doing a search for 'Danny Ayers not the American one' or similar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll sing you one-o, <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Danny Ayers</font> 
  in Arial...</p>
