<P>Hiya,</P>
<P>Just over a week in Sri Lanka and Caroline and I are now living in a room by 
  the sea, 3 rupees on the bus from the nearest town, Ambalangoda. </P>
<P>&nbsp; </P>
<P>I haven't got a digital camera (yet - planning to very soon) and not used up 
  a film yet in Caro's little camera, so I'll have to be a bit creative with the 
  visuals. For instance, can you guess what this is :</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/sg.jpg" width="200" height="554"></P>
<P align="center">and here's another mystery object :</P>
<P align="center"><img src="images/mystery.jpg" width="200" height="170"></P>
<h4>Animals</h4>
<P>A little gecko has just popped out from behind the books on the table in front 
  of me, gobbled a fly and disappeared behind the books again. <i>The ultimate 
  executive toy - a trained gecko! </i>There are quite a few around, sandy coloured 
  with big bug-eyes. We've seen a couple of larger (6&quot; body) lizards around 
  with very long tails and a ridiculous clockwork way of running. There are a 
  couple of cool crows in the trees outside, and a kingfisher that makes a lot 
  of noise. None of the minah birds I've seen have said anything. The fireflies 
  are good fun, there was one on the balcony last night, plain sandy coloured 
  thing about half the size of a woodlouse with arc-welding equipment in its trouser 
  pocket. Not so many bats here, not seen any monkeys or elephants in the neighborhood, 
  or snakes for that matter. Found a scary spider above the cistern the other 
  night - about the size of my palm with chubby legs. Also saw a fat dead rat 
  up the road yesterday, obviously too well fed to get across the road. </P>
<P>Bit of a horrible one - the Silvas have 4 dogs (Mr. Silva says they're not 
  theirs, but as they feed them and give them medication, I think they have some 
  claim...). One of the dogs had 5 puppies last week, because Mr. Silva's son, 
  Kelum, forgot to give it it's pill (eeeh, teenagers and contraceptives, I don't 
  know). Anyway, the dogs are all a bit scabby - pretty hard to avoid insects, 
  and they live outside. Caroline noticed that one of the puppies had a sizable 
  lump on it's back, with holes in it. On closer inspection, the holes ( and presumably 
  the lump) contained maggots. A bit weird, the sight of a cutey-cutey puppy along 
  with one of the most revolting things I've ever seen. I poured a bit of dilute 
  iodine down the holes yesterday, thinking it might help (don't think it did), 
  then today Kelum had put some powder on it. It seemed as lively as the others 
  today (which isn't very, the heat and probably the infestations subdue them 
  a bit), so I guess it'll be alright. Fingers crossed. That reminds me, rice 
  for tea...</P>

<h4>Vegetables</h4>
<p>Started cooking for ourselves on day 3, by day 6 we were on sandwiches. There's 
  a good veg. market in town, lovely fresh things that I don't know the name of, 
  carrots, wonderful leeks, brinjals (aubergines (eggplants)). Marmite<i> is</i> 
  available. The rice cooker we bought conveniently had a chinese plug on it. 
  Took the plug off to replace it with the one from Caro's hair drier to discover 
  I have late developing colourblindness - two green and one green and white wires. 
  Unscrewed the connector at the cooker end to make sure which was earth - good 
  job as wire only loosely twisted on. Fortunately, had packed soldering iron 
  for just such an emergency (dib dib dib), so safe-ish and working in no time. 
  Hair drier plug now replaced with the one from my soldering iron ;-(. </p>
<p>Here is the kitchen :</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/kitchen2.jpg" width="200" height="140"></p>
<p align="left">(the kitchen at Bennett Street, that is...)</p>
<p align="left">We've been going into town on the bus pretty much every other 
  day. The buses are well-packed, all the imaginable sitting and standing room 
  is taken, and then they add an in-fill of thin little old ladies. Ambalangoda 
  is quite dirty and noisy but very lively, but quite a good selection of shops, 
  most well stocked with chinese imported plastic things. Caroline's located a 
  stationery shop which does photocopies for 2 rs. a side. Can't seem to get A4 
  pads, everything is exercise-book style. There's a bookshop with a load of Penguin 
  Classics, so once we've got through Caro's boxload of novels we'll still have 
  reading material. Occasionally missing television, just to have something to 
  veg. out in front of. The radio's not bad, though not yet found a decent slot 
  for BBC World Service (got a Radio Times? could do with the freq. listings - 
  must reminder to try the web). Scanning FM the other day, got something that 
  sounded familiar - turned out to be 'All I Need is the Air that I Breathe' - 
  ok, but <i>what about the malaria pills?</i> Left the same station on, a couple 
  more BBC Radio 2 type songs that made me think, oh no, this sounds like a station 
  that would play <i>that song</i>. Sure enough, next one on was 'Seasons in the 
  Sun' - I *loath* it. Immediately channelled to some local sounds, some dancing 
  around trees music. Not really spotted the difference between the Lanka stuff 
  and the familiar Hindi style yet, except one song had a definite hint of the 
  'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' theme, and then another was very reminiscent of 'Yes 
  Sir, I can Boogie'.</p>
<p>Best grub here has to be curd (buffalo milk set-yoghurt stuff) and trickle 
  (<i>treacle</i> - kitul palm nectar) .</p>
<p>That first picture at the top - a scan of one end of a snake gourd (<i>did 
  you guess correctly?</i>), a wonderful veg. about a yard long.</p>
<p>Had an egg sandwich at a cafe in town yesterday, too late I realised I'd eaten 
  a whole green chili. Splutter!</p>
<p align="center">Here's a plan, roughly to scale, room 1 is about 15' square 
  :</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/map.gif" width="600" height="825"></p>
<p>The main road is a the top, which probably would be a bother for noise, if 
  it wasn't for the big wet noisy thing at the bottom. Didn't discover the shop 
  for a few days, never occurred to us there'd be an Asian shop on the corner. 
  It's very handy, a tiny booth, but a good range of stuff. Got a couple of eggs 
  yesterday, and like a lot of things they were wrapped in recycled paper (i.e. 
  it's folded and glued into a neat bag). The egg bag was someone's Maths homework 
  - a bit of algebra and some stuff on sets, with red ticks. </p>
<p>We're currently in room 1 (with a shower &amp; toilet at the back), though 
  the plan is to move into room 2 when it's ready as there is an extra room at 
  the back (somehow) which will have a sink in it. If I can accumulate a little 
  bit of dosh we might have both rooms, though it's not essential - the hot outdoors 
  is like having another huge room. Today I finished off the sink stand (only 
  cut my thumb once). Sometime in the next few days I'll start building a workbench. 
  I got the wood yesterday, quite farcical as the people at the timber yard didn't 
  speak English at all, but fortunately there was a customer that understood half-a-dozen 
  words and was very helpful. &lt;Just had to close the window at the bottom of 
  the map, I'm now sat in the bottom right hand corner of 1 - downpour started, 
  it'll only last 5 mins - very refreshing, but not for the laptop&gt;. When I 
  got it understood that I wanted quite strong wood (they had a lot of scratty 
  sub-pine stuff), I was presented with a six-foot, 6&quot;x2&quot; plank of mahogany, 
  and I thought &quot;Wow!&quot; Unfortunately it was 100 rupees (&pound;1) a 
  foot (I'm pretty sure this was the local price). Bought 3 foot of it to carve. 
  Later I saw some of it shaped for roof joists, someone must have a bit of money. 
  The stuff I ended up with for the bench was about 35rs a foot and somewhat harder 
  than pine, though not particularly seasoned and warping a bit. When it came 
  to paying, a little old man did the accounts in an exercise book which was already 
  covered in figures - I'd estimated about 2000rs for what I was getting, nearly 
  paid a lot more but fortunately the helpful customer noticed that the old man 
  had included one of the figures that was on his page already.</p>

<h4>Minerals</h4>
<p>Sri Lanka is famous for its gems, but our encounters with minerals have been 
  a bit less exotic. The water's not safe so it's got to be the mineral <i>water</i> 
  or boil-for-3-minutes. The gas ring burns with a yellow flame and covers everything 
  in lamp-black, which (as every schoolboy knows) is the mineral <i>tar</i>. I'd 
  got a bit of a sore in my mouth the other night and not having any TCP used 
  a bit of dilute iodine (1001 uses!), which was bloody revolting, like liquid 
  rust, i.e. the mineral<i> muck</i>. </p>
<p>The water is one of our biggest expenses, 45rs for 1.5 litres, not got around 
  to saving the boiled stuff yet. Found some cheap electrolyte-replacement powders, 
  a glass of water with this stuff clobbers any chance of dehydration.</p>
<p>* Update - we bought a posh gas ring, blue flame!! Curry for tea!</p>

<p>Had a wander down to the temple this afternoon - 1/2 mile towards town. Passed 
  the place we'd mistaken for here when we came first time - 'Randomba Hotel', 
  for locals rather than tourists, apparently. Outside there was a tatty bus with 
  a sign in the window saying <i>Semi Luxury Coach</i>. I kid you not.</p>
<p>We'd noticed a couple of little dagobas from the road, but when you go back 
  from the road the temple is quite a big place- one huge dagoba, big old Bo tree 
  (some girls were walking around it carrying flames as an old woman read aloud 
  from a book) and a building with some marvellous 3D freezes of various deities 
  (Buddhist, Hindu, probably a few Presbyterian), coming out of the wall at you. 
  Quite a few smiley kids there (<i>Hello! What is your name?</i> repeated ad 
  nauseum). In an inner room, an enormous (his head was about my height) reclining 
  Buddha. There was a row of life-size Buddhas (made of plaster I think) around 
  the outside of the room with the big Buddha, one or two were damaged revealing 
  a wooden skeleton - <i>tres </i>Terminator. At the feet of the many-Buddhas 
  was a procession of 2-foot high people giving respect. Except one of the 20 
  or so little people wasn't a person but a cobra. Odd.</p>
<p>We had a wander up a road leading off the main road, houses as far as we walked, 
  a curious mix of quite fancy-looking places (including metal gates and tv aerials) 
  and, well, huts. A couple of women spinning coconut fibre (using bicycle wheels) 
  and a few more smiley kids (<i>Hello! What is your name?Hello! What is your 
  name?Hello! What is your name?Hello! What is your name?</i> ). Most of both 
  kinds of dwelling had nice gardens. Walked back along the beach, very nice for 
  the most part but pestered by the only two lads in sight, well practised in 
  the art of latching on. <i>(People call us Gutspluuuurger, and we eat small 
  children...)</i></p>
<p>Off too Colombo next week to renew visas. There's a train station in Ambalangoda, 
  and the station in Colombo is near the immigration office, so getting there 
  shouldn't be too difficult. Considered spending a couple of nights in Negombo 
  (spell?) , to see the boats &amp; lagoons, but it turns out (according to Mr. 
  S) there's the same kind of thing just a little north of here, without the tourists.</p>
<p>Not really got as much work done as I'd have liked in the past couple of weeks, 
  but only to be expected. Working on the laptop's great, now got Caro's machine 
  networked - can access the testbed web server on this one using a browser on 
  her's. Internet access still means a trip with laptop up to the house, but our 
  own line should be connected soon. The connection seems remarkably good, not 
  had any probs since I got it going. If you get fed up with Freeserve, Virgin, 
  Demon or whatever, I'd definitely recommend Panlanka (<i>'LANs for Planks'</i>). 
  Anyhow, work's ok, but other activities (shopping, cooking, sawing wood, walking 
  on the beach, watching geckos...) seem to take a lot longer than usual.</p>
<p>Caroline's got started with her teaching - had her first class the other night 
  with Mr. Silva's daughter, Sujeeva, and three of her friends, all lawyers, dressed 
  in immaculate white saris (except Caroline, of course). They're all quite good 
  at English, which has given Caro a bit of a headache as she's only brought books 
  up to 'Intermediate'. Amazon will deliver, but it could take a while. She should 
  have enough to keep 'em going a few weeks anyway. Got Boggle and Scrabble...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sod all else to report, so here's the solution to the second picture puzzle 
  - it's my nose!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/dannyinbasement.jpg" width="300" height="451"></p>
<p>No, that isn't in Sri Lanka either. Note work shirt - never to be worn again, 
  strictly string vests from now on!</p>
<p>Hoping to get a good night's sleep tonight - it's very hot and there are lots 
  of strange sounds, but I've now finished reading 'Hannibal', the sequel to 'Silence 
  of the Lambs' (which I haven't seen/read), so that should make it easier. Very 
  good read (thanks, Chris!), but a bit implausible in places - though I must 
  approve of having Hannibal the Cannibal - the book would have been a lot less 
  interesting with Hannibal the Bus Conductor or whatever.. Caro's been reading 
  the latest 'Bridget Jones' Dreary' book (thanks again, Chris!), inspired her 
  to start writing her own - <i>Wed 13th, new mosquito bites 3 - not bad, papaya 
  and mango for breakfast 3000 calories - fair... </i></p>
<p>One last gecko story - came in earlier and saw one gecko run along the wall 
  and sink its teeth (?) into another gecko's neck. It looked quite vicious, so 
  I made a flapping bird with my hands and they darted to opposite corners. They're 
  now at the top of the wall, entwined like curly candlesticks. I think I might 
  have commited a gecko faux pas...</p>
