<P>I'd pretty much given up on this web host, so I sent some piccies as attachments 
  for this poya. Finally seems to be working again, so here are the piccies, with 
  the notes I put in the mail ::</P>
<P align="center"> the layout of where we're staying, we're currently using 1 
  as a bedroom/office(!) and 2 (which needs some work) as a kitchen/classroom(!!), 
  but soon we're just going to have room 2 - the purple dashes are a rough fence 
  and the route the path to the beach will take (once we've finished the garden)

<P align="center">Caroline standing on the rock marked on the map. The beach disappeared 
  for a while, monsoon weather took the sea right up to the edge of the garden, 
  but now it's returned, revealing a load more good rocks to sit on. window.jpg 
  - view out of the bedroom window. My desk (where I'm sat now) is in the corner 
  just to the right off the picture.</P>

<P align="center"> me gardening. Got rid of most of that stuff ('rana'?), except 
  lots of *very* stubborn flying roots. </P>

<P align="center">I was working away happily on the laptop until I saw this fellow 
  inches from my arm. Most of its body is over the desk corner - it was actually 
  about 4 1/2 ft long. The photo is blurred because I was shaking somewhat. Not 
  venomous, allegedly. </P>

<P align="center">All's well here, still not out of monsoon season fully yet - 
  overcast & a bit of rain today. Most days are (very) hot & sunny though (most 
  of this batch of photo's were 1/2 bleached out and 1/2 virtually black, despite 
  using decent film - the local developer is called "Edwin's", by the way - good 
  Derbyshire name). Getting on with work ok, (me programming/writing, Caroline 
  teaching English) despite unusual distractions - apart from the visitor in the 
  picture, we also had a bat in the kitchen, flap, flap, flap, and have had sizable 
  monitor lizards in the garden, as well regular squirrels, occasional huge fruitbats 
  and a mongoose in the garden, and there was a scorpion in one of the other rooms. 
  There's something living in the roof space, Mr. Silva thinks it's a wild cat, 
  but I rather think it's squirrels or perhaps a bat. Then there's the (welcome) 
  geckos on the bedroom walls - caught one crunching a huge beetle last night, 
  and of course mosquitos, flies and ants in abundance. I've spent the last month 
  making a workbench, should have it finished in a couple of weeks then I can 
  get on with some carving. Caro's been learning web design in her spare time.
