<h2>Status : <i>an idea</i></h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>A hive of bees is a colony of <a href="#foraging">foraging</a> insects, which 
  spend a lot of time out and about gathering nectar from flowers. Each worker 
  bee acts as an individual agent, and when it has successfully found a good source 
  of food it returns to the hive with its payload and communicates to other bees 
  in the hive the location of more nectar by means of the remarkable symbolic 
  <a href="http://alcor.concordia.ca/%7Ema_marsz/waggle.html">waggle dance</a> 
  (also the name of a <a href="http://www.bottledbeer.co.uk/beer.asp?beerid=77">fine 
  ale</a>). The workers collect two kinds of food - nectar (which gets turned 
  into honey) and pollen. </p>
<p>flowers = web pages (with embedded metadata, or linked RDF)</p>
<p>pollen = RDF</p>
<p>nectar = page that satisfies client</p>
<p>hive = Ape server : consisting of proxy web server, RDF DB, HTML &amp; RDF 
  parsers, web server generating UI page</p>
<p>bee = 1 instance of proxy</p>
<p>UI page contains user feedback frame</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Client &lt;-&gt; Ape server &lt;-&gt; web</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pollenation</h2>
<p>In the same way that bees carry pollen from flower to flower thus playing a 
  vital role in the life history of the plant, it is also a possibility that the 
  kind of agent described here could offer a service to hosts it visits - the 
  addition of a few characters to the standard URLs of the pages it visits could 
  facilitate a dialogue between the host and the agent, which could be used to 
  supply the host with select parts of the RDF payload - i.e.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.swarm.org/intro.html">Swarm</a> - Swarm is a software package 
  for multi-agent simulation of complex systems, originally developed at the Santa 
  Fe Institute. Swarm is intended to be a useful tool for researchers in a variety 
  of disciplines. The basic architecture of Swarm is the simulation of collections 
  of concurrently interacting agents: with this architecture, we can implement 
  a large variety of agent based models. The Swarm software is available to the 
  general public under GNU licensing terms. Swarm is experimental software, which 
  means that it's complete enough to be useful but will always be under development.<br>

<p><a href="http://www.hivecell.net/hive.html">Hive</a> is a Java software platform 
  for creating distributed applications. Using Hive, programmers can easily create 
  systems that connect and use data from all over the Internet. At its heart, 
  Hive is an environment for distributed agents to live, communicating and moving 
  to fulfill applications. We are trying to make the Internet alive. </p>
