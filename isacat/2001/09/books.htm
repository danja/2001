<h1 align="center">Semantic Web Related Books</h1>
<p>It's rare that I get to visit a decent bookshop or library, and in any case 
  a lot of the SW-related material available is a bit too obscure for most places. 
  As a result I spend a lot of money on books (usually through Amazon) that are 
  useless, unreadable or both. Here, in the hope that it might be of use to others 
  in similar circumstances are a few books that I have found useful or interesting.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions to add to the list in the subject areas below or 
  anything else relevant (e.g. the list could do with some more on Topic Maps), 
  please <a href="mailto:danny@isacat.net">mail me</a> - you might reduce the 
  money I waste.</p>

<h3>Weaving the Web</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> 2000 <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/hc/aboutus/imprints/business.asp">Harper 
  Business</a> </h6>
<p> The definitive lay backgrounder, covering the history of the (semantic) web, 
  and its 'Ultimate Destiny'. Provides interesting insights into the timbl namespace. 
  Must-have book for lovers of techie autobiography - more readable than the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/cwm.py">source 
  code to cwm</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center">RDF<a name="rdf"></a></h2>
<h3>Creating the Semantic Web with RDF</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.wireless-information.net/Johan/whois.htm">Johan Hjelm</a> 
  2001 <a href="http://www.wiley.com/compbooks">Wiley</a></h6>
<p>Given the state of the art, this is a fine effort. Takes a practical approach, 
  describing the use of available RDF tools. The style is quite informal, and 
  entertainingly opinionated in places. Includes good introductory material on 
  RDF/XML, and touches on a lot of related specs ( RSS, DC of course, but also 
  things like KQML). Notably includes a chapter 'Device Descriptions and User 
  Profiles', which I think we can take as being pretty authoratative, given the 
  authors's role in the development of CC/PP. Contains some introductory material 
  on reasoning, ontologies and agents. There isn't (yet) a better primer for the 
  Semantic Web.</p>
<h3>RDF Specification</h3>
<h6><a href="http://ilrt.org/people/danbri/">Dan Brickley</a> *, et al 2000 <a href="http://www.iuniverse.com">iUniverse</a> 
</h6>
<p>The RDF M&amp;S and RDF Schema specs bound in paperback book form. Delightfully 
  described by Mr. Brickley as a 'cheesy piece of shovelware'. I bought a copy 
  because I'm seriously fed up of carting around and sorting through masses and 
  masses of A4 copy, but unless you suffer from similar problems, just get a printout. 
  On the other hand, if danbri brings out a book himself, buy it. (* not to be 
  confused with the other visionary author, <a href="http://www.mm2000.nu/brinkley.html">Dan 
  Brinkley</a>) </p>
<h3>Professional XML Meta Data</h3>
<h6>Various 2001 <a href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox Press</a></h6>
<p>Usual Wrox style book with 11 authors (including <a href="http://www.isacat.net/misc/biog.htm">myself</a>) 
  providing a variety of angles. Practically orientated, it contains quite a bit 
  of code. Covers (from scratch) RDF, Topic Maps, MDL (Meaning Definition Language), 
  extracting metadata from DBs, metadata architectures etc, etc. Good material, 
  but reprehensibly thin on inferencing.</p>
<h3>Professional XML</h3>
<h6>Various 2001 <a href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox Press</a> (2nd Ed.)</h6>
<p>Contains a couple of relevant chapters : 'RDF' and 'RDF Code Samples and RDDL'.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center">Knowledge Bases<a name="kbs"></a></h2>
<h3>Knowledge Representation : Logical, Philosophical and Computational Foundations</h3>
<h6><a href="http://users.bestweb.net/%7Esowa/">John F. Sowa</a> 2000 <a href="http://www.brookscole.com">Brooks/Cole</a></h6>
<p>A remarkable book. It goes from Aristotle right up to current ideas on logic 
  and knowledge engineering, all covered in a highly authoritative but reasonably 
  readable fashion. The style is academic, but it's well-illustrated and contains 
  code snippets (Prolog, KIF etc) where appropriate. In parts it can be hard work, 
  but this is largely due to the density of the information. Not surprisingly, 
  Sowa's babies, Conceptual Graphs are well covered, but so is pretty much everything 
  in the krep field (I'm sure I even saw a reference to RDF in there somewhere, 
  though it's not in the index). For a better idea of what's in this book check 
  out Sowa's <a href="http://users.bestweb.net/%7Esowa/krbook/">site</a>. Stongly 
  recommended.</p>
<h3>The Logic of Knowledge Bases </h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/DCS/People/Faculty/hector.html">Hector 
  J. Levesque</a> &amp; <a href="Gerhard%20Lakemeyer">Gerhard Lakemeyer</a> 2000 
  <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu">The MIT Press</a> </h6>
Interesting &amp; seems pretty original, but fairly heavy going as it takes a 
solidly mathematical approach. The authors build up from a fairly straightforward 
predicate logic, adding semantic extensions chapter by chapter to cover aspects 
of KBs. Covers things like ASK &amp; TELL and a situation calculus. 
<hr>
<h2 align="center">Logic<a name="logic"></a> </h2>
<h3>The Language of First-Order Logic</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www-vil.cs.indiana.edu/barwise.html">Jon Barwise</a> &amp; 
  <a href="http://www-csli.stanford.edu/hp/etchemendy.html">John Etchemendy</a> 
  1992 CLSI</h6>
<p>Logic 101. Goes from simple intro to predicate logic up to Godel's Incompleteness 
  (in brief). Includes (Windows) software for a blocks world on which wffs can 
  be tested. </p>
<h3>Computability and Logic</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www-tech.mit.edu/V116/N28/boolos.28n.html">George S. Boolos</a> 
  &amp; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books-uk&field-author=Jeffrey%2C%20Richard%20C./026-3289649-9024420">Richard 
  C. Jeffrey </a>1980 <a href="http://www.cup.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge University 
  Press</a></h6>
<p>Fairly formal coverage of first-order logic and Turing Machines, recursion 
  etc. (I've only got an old edition).</p>
<h3>Communicating and Mobile Systems : The Pi Calculus </h3>
<h6>Robert Milner 1999 <a href="http://www.cup.cam.ac.uk">Cambridge University 
  Press</a></h6>
<p>Logic for Room 101 - not for the fainthearted! Largely formal mathematical 
  description of a new calculus that can powerfully describe information systems 
  from a communications point of view (hence this could be very useful for internet 
  entities such as mobile agents). I would strongly recommend the<a href="http://www.lfcs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/reports/91/ECS-LFCS-91-180/ECS-LFCS-91-180.ps"> 
  tutorial </a>first, unless you are a hardcore maths junky.</p>
<h3>An Introduction to Non-Classical Logic</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.philosophy.unimelb.edu.au/Staff/staff.htm">Graham Priest</a> 
  2001 <a href="http://www.cambridge.org">Cambridge University Press</a></h6>
<p>Introduces various different logics (including fuzzy logic) in a clear &amp; 
  conscise fashion. Remarkably easy to follow, thanks mainly to the use of tableaux 
  (which are introduced &amp; described). Probably the only book I'd recommend 
  with an introduction entitled 'Mathematical Prolegomenon'.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center">Other AI<a name="other"></a></h2>
<p><i>It might be argued that some of the books below aren't particularly relevant, 
  but my opinion is that logic/KB approaches alone won't be anywhere near adequate 
  to provide the facilities envisaged in the Semantic Web concept. There are hundreds 
  of other books that could go here - but I haven't read 'em.</i></p>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence<a name="russell"></a> : A Modern Approach</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erussell/">Stuart J. Russell</a> and 
  <a href="http://www.norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a> 1995 Prentice Hall (I believe 
  a new edition is on the way)</h6>
<p>Someone (danc?) commented that this was essential reading - I agree. It's an 
  excellent, wide-ranging introduction. Strongly recommended.</p>
<h3>Essentials of Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.cirl.uoregon.edu/ginsberg/">Matt Ginsberg</a> 1993 <a href="http://www.mkp.com">Morgan 
  Kaufmann</a></h6>
<p>Slightly less comprehensive than <a href="#russell">Russell &amp; Norvig</a>, 
  but pretty good all the same.</p>
<h3>Expert Systems : Principles and Programming</h3>
<h6>Joseph Giarratano &amp; Gary Riley 1989 (there are more recent editions) PWS</h6>
<p>Introduces predicate logic, inference etc in a straightforward and clear fashion 
  including quite a bit of coverage of probability and inexact reasoning. The 
  second half of the book is a tutorial for the CLIPS expert system shell. (Note 
  - I've only got an old copy of this, presumably a lot will have been updated).</p>
<h3>Intelligent Database Systems</h3>
<h6>Bertino, Catania &amp; Zarri 2001 <a href="http://www.aw.com/cseng">Addison-Wesley</a></h6>
<p>Though it does contain some theory, this is largely a review (with descriptions) 
  of implementations. The first part of the book is an intro, the second part 
  covers 'Efforts originated in a prevailing DB context' including material on 
  relational &amp; OO DBs, OMT, UML modelling, ODMG standard etc. The third part 
  'Efforts originated in a prevailing AI context' describes expert systems and 
  moves on to deductive databases (e.g. DATALOG) and other such approaches, including 
  an interesting discussion of Cyc.This section actually includes a little RDF 
  - in discussion about an implementation of NKRL (narrative knowledge representation 
  language). The final part, 'The Latest Developments' includes a smattering of 
  these, e.g. temporal DBs, data mining, search engines.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Acquisition from Databases</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/%7Exwu/home.html">Xindong Wu</a> 1995 Ablex 
  Publishing Corporation</h6>
<p>Appears like a bunch of academic papers, but contains good material on decision 
  tree algorithms, a couple of knowledge base implementations and some tools for 
  rule generation.</p>
<h3>Constructing Intelligent Agents using Java</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/b/bigus/home.html">Joseph P. Bigus 
  </a>&amp; <a href="http://www.icca.org/firms/f21421.htm">Jennifer Bigus </a>2001 
  <a href="http://www.wiley.com/compbooks">Wiley</a> (2nd Ed.)</p>
<p>This looks really good - not had time to read it yet though...</p>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<h6>Tom M. Mitchell 1997<a href="http://www.mhcollege.com"> McGraw-Hill</a></h6>
<p>Fairly formal treatment of learning theory, mainly concerned with neural nets, 
  Bayesian techniques etc, but does cover rule learning and decision trees.</p>
<h3>Object-Oriented Neural Networks in C++ </h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.gti-us.com/sjr.htm">Joey Rogers</a> 1997 <a href="http://www.apnet.com">Academic 
  Press</a></h6>
<p>A good book for implementers comfortable with OO and with a little background 
  knowledge of neural nets. Covers the most common nets with descriptions, formalizations 
  &amp; source code.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Genetic Algorithms</h3>
<h6><a href="http://www.santafe.edu/%7Emm/">Melanie Mitchell</a> 1998 <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu">The 
  MIT Press</a></h6>
<p>A very good introduction, which actually goes quite deep and wide.</p>
<h3>Professional Java Mobile Programming</h3>
<h6>Various 2001 <a href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox Press</a></h6>
<p>Only listed because it includes a chapter I wrote describing a simple expert 
  system for the Palm, which you can find <a href="../code/kex.htm">here</a>.</p>
<h2 align="center">Other <a name="other"></a></h2>
<div align="left"> 
  <h3>Data Mining</h3>
  <h6><a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/%7Eihw/">Ian H. Witten </a>&amp; <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/%7Eeibe/">Eibe 
    Frank</a> 2000 <a href="http://www.mkp.com">Morgan Kaufmann</a></h6>
  <p>A good practical introduction to machine learning in this context, plenty 
    of this should be applicable to the web. The book is readable and has pretty 
    good coverage. Java implementations of the tools are available from the web.</p>
