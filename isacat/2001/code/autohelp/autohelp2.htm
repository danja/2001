<h2>JavaHelp </h2>
<p>Even if you have not used JavaHelp itself, the end product will not be unfamiliar 
  as the system provides a set of tools found in many other applications, such 
  as Windows Help. We are not be concerned here with the detailed workings of 
  JavaHelp, but with its mode of storing data.</p>
<p>We are going to use JavaHelp to provide a system looking something like this 
  :</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'> <img border=0 width=553 height=369
src="images/image004.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1026"> </p>
<p class=layoutnotes-PRODUCTION>snake1.bmp</p>
<p>Rather than a help system in the usual sense, called up from within a parent 
  application, here we are using JavaHelp as a standalone application to present 
  an electronic book from the 'Programmer to Zookeeper' line. In this <b>Contents</b> 
  view the panel on the left shows the available documents in a navigable tree 
  layout. Double-clicking on the folders causes them to reveal or hide their contents, 
  clicking on the lollipop icon cause the tree to expand or contract. The panel 
  on the right displays the document currently selected in the left-hand panel. 
  At the top of the panel on the left are another two more tabs, clicking the 
  next of these shows the <b>Index</b> view : </p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'> <img border=0 width=553 height=369
src="images/image006.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"> </p>
<p class=layoutnotes-PRODUCTION>snake2.bmp</p>
<p>In this view the list on the left can be scrolled down the list to the entry 
  we are interested in, or the term we are looking for may be typed into the <b>Find:</b> 
  text entry box. When the required term is highlighted on the left, the corresponding 
  document is displayed on the right. It is usual to create the index in alphabetical 
  order, though this is entirely optional, as is the order of the folders in the 
  <b>Contents</b> view. If any of the material in the panels extends beyond the 
  visible area, a scrollbar is provided.</p>
<p>The third tab is for a search view, the indexing tools for which are already 
  integrated into JavaHelp, so aren't of much interest here. Later however we 
  will briefly show how this facility is used. </p>
