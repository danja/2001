<h4 align="center">KVM Expert System, Version 1.1</h4>
<h4 align="center"><img src="images/load2.gif" width="160" height="160"></h4>
<p>This application is a simple expert system for the Palm, developed using the 
  J2ME Palm release (CLDC and kjava). It will ask questions based on a knowledge 
  base specified in a Palm Memo (in XML). From the user's responses to the questions 
  (<code>Yes/Know/Don't Know</code>) it will resolve rules in the knowledge base 
  to reach a goal. </p>
<p>Interesting bits include a (kjava) Memo reader, mini-XML parser, representation 
  of facts and rules in Java and a simple inference engine. There isn't any documentation 
  with the source, this will hopefully be appearing in a forthcoming book. I described 
  in a presentation at the <a href="http://www.mumjava.com">MumJava</a> conference, 
  and here are the<a href="../bombay/mumjava.htm"> presentation materials</a>. 
  (these materials refer to v 1.0)</p>
<h5>Prerequisites : </h5>
<ul>
  <li> A Palm or compatible device with the KVM from Sun Microsystems loaded (KVM.prc 
    and KVMutil.prc)</li>
  <li> Memo application (as supplied with Palm device)</li>
  <li> A knowledge base is also required, see below.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Files :</h5>
<p><a href="download/kex/kex_code.zip">kex_code.zip</a> - v1.1 everything </p>
<p>same functionality, tighter code</p>

  Palm application<br>
  <br>

<h5>------------------------------------------------------------------------</h5>
<p>* note in use in a Palm Memo for this app, the XML must be preceded with a 
  line in the following format :</p>
<p><code>Kex &quot;<i>knowledgebasename</i>&quot;</code></p>
<p>in the example, knowledgebasename = Example</p>
<p>The app uses this line to recognise the Memo. This line has been commented 
  out in the file <a href="download/kex/release/example.xml">example.xml</a> to 
  allow viewing of the XML.</p>
<p><br>
  <b>Installation : </b></p>
<p>1. Open the file example.xml with a text editor (e.g. Windows notepad) and 
  run the desktop application you normally use for Palm Memos (i.e. Palm Desktop 
  or MS Outlook). Select the whole text of example.xml and copy and paste exactly 
  as it reads into your application (as a new 'Memo' in Palm Desktop or a new 
  'Note' in MS Outlook). </p>
<p>2. Use the Palm install tool to load the application file (double-clicking 
  on Kex.prc should do this). </p>
<p>3. Use Hotsync to transfer the application and sample data to your Palm. </p>
<h5>Use (with example knowledge base) : </h5>
<ol>
  <li>If you wish to use the logging facility, run KVMutil on the Palm and tick 
    the 'Save Output' checkbox.</li>
  <li> Ensure that 'Screen Output' is set to 0 lines. </li>
  <li>Tap the 'Kex' application icon (initially in 'Unfiled') to run the application.</li>
  <li>Enter the name of the knowledge base you wish to load - the test data provided 
    is called 'example', enter this without punctuation or spaces.</li>
  <li>Tick the 'Log' checkbox if you wish to use the logging facility (note that 
    this slows the application considerably). </li>
  <li>Tap the 'Load' button, and the application will take a short while to locate 
    and load the knowledge base. If the application cannot find the example knowledge 
    base, check in Memo that there is an entry called Kex "Example". </li>
  <li>Think of one of the following things : 'mouse', 'bird', 'helicopter' or 
    'stone'.</li>
</ol>
<p>You will be asked a question about the thing you have thought of, tap the 'Yes', 
  'No' or 'Don't Know' as appropriate.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/question.gif" width="160" height="160"></p>
<p>Further questions will be presented until the system can reach a conclusion. 
  Tapping 'Quit' will return you to the start screen, from where you may begin 
  another run or exit the application. The application log can be viewed by running 
  KVMutil and tapping 'View Output'.</p>
<p>The log is verbose, and shows how the inference engine reaches it's conclusion. 
  The log of a run using the example data can be viewed <a href="download/kex/log.htm">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Sample Knowledge Base</h5>
<p>The knowledge base supplied in example.xml contains the following 'expert' 
  information : </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><cite>There are four different kinds 
  of things in the world : mouse, bird, helicopter and a stone. </cite></font></p>
<p><cite><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">You can tell them apart because 
  : </font></cite></p>
<p><cite><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">1. A mouse is alive but can't 
  fly.<br>
  2. A helicopter can fly but isn't alive. <br>
  3. A stone isn't alive and can't fly. </font></cite></p>
<p>Note that the bird is defined implicitly - if the thing is not one of the other 
  three, then (no matter how improbable!) it must be a bird. </p>
<p>This information is expressed in terms of facts (which may also be questions 
  or goals) : </p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="236" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td><code>Mouse (goal)<br>
      Bird (goal) <br>
      Helicopter (goal) <br>
      Stone (goal) <br>
      Can it fly (question) <br>
      Is it alive (question) alive </code></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<div align="center"></div>
<div align="center"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship between the facts is expressed in terms of rules : </p>
<table width="31%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td><code>1. IF alive AND NOT Can it fly THEN Mouse <br>
      2. IF Can it fly AND NOT alive THEN Helicopter <br>
      3. IF NOT alive AND NOT Can it fly THEN Stone <br>
      4. IF Is it alive THEN alive </code></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These facts and rules above are coded in the XML document <a href="download/kex/release/example.xml">example.xml</a> 
</p>
<h5>Building Knowledge Bases</h5>
<p> The expert information should first be expressed in terms of facts and rules 
  as above. </p>
<p><br>
  All the facts that will be used should be listed first. </p>
<p><br>
  The left-hand side of the IF...THEN... statements should contain one or more 
  facts, separated by logical AND operators (interpretation of OR isn't implemented), 
  and preceded by the logical NOT operator if required. <br>
</p>
<p> The logical operators are strictly applied, and as the reminder the AND operation 
  is as follows : </p>
<table width="12%" border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" align="center">
  <tr> 
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center"><b>a</b></div>
    </td>
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center"><b>b</b></div>
    </td>
    <td width="47%"> 
      <div align="center"><b>a AND b</b></div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center">false</div>
    </td>
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center">false</div>
    </td>
    <td width="47%"> 
      <div align="center">false</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center">false</div>
    </td>
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center">true</div>
    </td>
    <td width="47%"> 
      <div align="center">false</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center">true</div>
    </td>
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center">false</div>
    </td>
    <td width="47%"> 
      <div align="center">false</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center">true</div>
    </td>
    <td width="23%"> 
      <div align="center">true</div>
    </td>
    <td width="47%"> 
      <div align="center">true</div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The right-hand side of the IF...THEN... statements should contain a single 
  fact, preceded by the NOT operator if required. </p>
<p>This information can then be entered as an XML document, either using a text 
  editor or preferably using an XML editor with the DTD file <a href="download/kex/release/kex.dtd">kex.dtd</a> 
  loaded. </p>
<p>The list of all facts must come before the rules. </p>
<p>The way in which the information is formatted as XML can be seen by comparing 
  the facts and rules above with contents of the <a href="download/kex/release/example.xml">example.xml 
  </a>file. </p>
<p>The size limit of a knowledge base has not yet been determined, but larger 
  knowledge bases will take substantially more time to process than small ones. 
  The XML file should then have an extra header line added to identify the Memo 
  : <code>Kex "kbname"</code> where kbname is the name of the knowledge base (the 
  quotes <b>are </b>required). The resulting text file can then be loaded into 
  the Palm Memo database as above, and the application run.</p>
