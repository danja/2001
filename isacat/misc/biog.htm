      <h4>The Nearest I Can Be Bothered To Writing A CV</h4>
      <p>I spend a lot of my time coding in Java and playing with related web 
        technologies and writing about them. I'm occasionally available for consultation, 
        or even speaking. I wouldn't for a moment say I was a professional in 
        the field, rather an amateur who works (engineering information) to support 
        his hobby (engineering information). Having said that I have contributed 
        to several books (engineering information) with 'professional' in the 
        title, all published by <a href="http://www.wrox.com">Wrox Press</a>. 
        I also do quite a bit of peer reviewing. </p>
      <p>I'm currently living in <a href="../photos/garfagnana/index.htm">northern 
        Italy</a> with my wife <a href="../caroline/carobiog.htm">Caroline</a>.</p>
      <p>I've been interested in AI for many years (&gt; 20) and have worked for 
        several years on network technologies. I'm delighted to see these two 
        fields are now converging before my very eyes, in the form of the web, 
        soon to be formerly known as the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/2001/0501issue/0501berners-lee.html">Semantic 
        Web</a>.</p>
      <p>Spare time (i.e. rare) activities usually include woodcarving and doing 
        electronic music stuff - I'm familiar with analogue &amp; digital electronics 
        for music, but haven't had the soldering iron out for a very long time.</p>
      <p>I've not had chance to do any music stuff for ages (I've been laptop 
        based for the last year or so) but there's <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/152/djayers.html">one 
        of mine here</a> (mp3 format - mp3.com are great, they stream things at 
        either 128bps - too fast for a normal modem or 24 bps - too slow to sound 
        any good, unless you like <i>crunchy</i>...). </p>
      <p> I've had to wait ages to be reunited with my woodcarving tools (from 
        Sri Lanka via the UK), so in the meantime I've been trying to paint in 
        oils - <a href="../photos/painting/painting.htm">I've got this far</a>.</p>
