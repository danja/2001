<p><em><a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">Cool URIs don't
change</a>, and uncool ones do.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p>The <a href="http://web.archive.org">Internet Archive</a> has some of my
stuff dating back to <strong>March 1997</strong> with the site name "<a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010519095624/http://www.telephone.demon.co.uk/">Telephone
Demon</a>" - this version is from 2001 when it seems like I had most material
online: 10 pages. The site name came about because hosting came free with
demon.co.uk and you had to do it over the phone...try to think of an
interesting word when you're on the phone. </p>

<p>I did have another site set up around the same period I called
"<em>Intermittent</em>", but as far as I remember there wasn't very much by way
of content - but it did have a very stylish (er, dated, frames-based) front
page. That one's dropped off the Web altogether (looks like its URIs were
<em>http://www.danja.free-online.co.uk/</em> - not archived, and
<em>http://members.xoom.com/dayers</em> - robots.txt blocked).</p>

<p>Fast-forward to around <strong>2000</strong> and I had (at least) two domain
names registered, but now those domains are long gone. What's rather irritating
is that the new owners of the domains (name-grabbers) have robots.txt in place
so the Internet Archive doesn't have a copy. </p>

<p>But I did keep a backup on CD (labelled 29/09/2001), so here they are (under
this domain): <a href="isacat/index.htm">isacat.net</a> and <a
href="citnames/index.htm">citnames.com</a>. (I've tweaked the front pages a
minute amount, the rest is as-was).</p>
