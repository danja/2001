<h1 align="center">Den of Trust<br>
  (and other stories)</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the assumptions underlying current approaches to the Semantic Web may 
  need further consideration. There is no doubt that there are benefits to be 
  had from the addition of metadata to web pages, and the appliance of inference 
  engines to these more multidimensional documents will surely make the kind of 
  information retrieval tasks in common use today more satisfying. There are expectations 
  by some of revolution from these technologies, but I strongly suspect that there 
  are certain problems that are unsurmountable without a significant shift in 
  approach, before the expectations are likely to be achieved. </p>
<h4>Web of Folly</h4>
<p>The idea of a Web of Trust is based on fallacy. The fallacy is that anyone 
  (any resource) can be trusted 100%. Ok, put this way the statement is unlikely 
  to be challenged - I don't have a proof, but is any crypto algorithm provably 
  cracker-proof? (Godel could perhaps help here). Realistically I think it's reasonable 
  to assume not. How do we build a web of trust? We know we can trust party A, 
  they say party B is trustworthy, therefore we trust party B. </p>
<h4>The Crux</h4>
<p>First order logic and suchlike @@@ don't map to human reality</p>
<h4>Mapping</h4>
<p>Consider the the universe that machine-augmented humans can ((perceive OR imagine) 
  AND communicate). The web will map to a subset of this space, will it not? </p>
