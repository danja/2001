Just take as an axiom that the relationship between
a URI and a resource *is* the same as the relationship
between a logical name and what it denotes. Try it
on for size for a while.


the contents of a file (a byte sequence) is not the file
(a mutable object whose state at any given time is a byte sequence).
The value stored in a database cell is not the cell.
A picture of me is not me.
Just because the current trading price of ATT was $100 at
one time does not mean that $100 is equal
to the function that returns the trading price of ATT
given the current time.

You might think of a resource (what a URI denotes)
as a function from requests to responses, much
like a variable is a function from the state
of the program to a value.



Huh? This is a fallacy of undistributed middle:

	All URIs are names.
	My computer can find [out about] denotations of URIs.
	-> my computer should be able to find out about denotations
	of all names.

Ontology: A formal, explicit specification of how to represent the objects, concepts, and other entities in a particular system, as well as the relationships between them 

Morphological: A morpheme is the smallest part of a word that can carry a discrete meaning. Morphological analysis works with words at this level. Typically, a natural-language processor knows how to understand multiple forms of a word: its plural and singular, for example. 

Syntactic: At this level, natural-language processors focus on structural information and relationships. 

Semantic: Natural-language processors derive an absolute (dictionary definition) meaning from context. 

Pragmatic: Natural-language processors derive knowledge from external commonsense information.
