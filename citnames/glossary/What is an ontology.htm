ontology is an explicit specification of some topic. For our purposes, it is a 
formal and declarative representation which includes the vocabulary (or names) 
for referring to the terms in that subject area and the logical statements that 
describe what the terms are, how they are related to each other, and how they 
can or cannot be related to each other. Ontologies therefore provide a 
vocabulary for representing and communicating knowledge about some topic and a 
set of relationships that hold among the terms in that vocabulary.
